GAStech provides many of their employees with company cars for their personal and professional use, but unbeknownst to the employees, the cars are equipped with GPS tracking devices. You are given tracking data for the two weeks leading up to the disappearance, as well as credit card transactions and loyalty card usage data. From this data, can you identify anomalies and suspicious behaviors? Can you identify which people use which credit and loyalty cards?\r\nData Preparation\r\nload packages\r\nThe code chunk below will check if the necessary R packages have been installed, if not, R will install the missing R packages before launching them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nload data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDA\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1,490 x 7\r\n   timestamp           location   price last4ccnum ts_new             \r\n   <dttm>              <chr>      <dbl> <chr>      <dttm>             \r\n 1 2014-01-06 07:28:00 Brew've B~ 11.3  4795       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n 2 2014-01-06 07:34:00 Hallowed ~ 52.2  7108       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n 3 2014-01-06 07:35:00 Brew've B~  8.33 6816       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n 4 2014-01-06 07:36:00 Hallowed ~ 16.7  9617       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n 5 2014-01-06 07:37:00 Brew've B~  4.24 7384       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n 6 2014-01-06 07:38:00 Brew've B~  4.17 5368       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n 7 2014-01-06 07:42:00 Coffee Ca~ 28.7  7253       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n 8 2014-01-06 07:43:00 Brew've B~  9.6  4948       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n 9 2014-01-06 07:43:00 Brew've B~ 16.9  9683       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n10 2014-01-06 07:47:00 Hallowed ~ 16.5  8129       2014-01-06 07:00:00\r\n# ... with 1,480 more rows, and 2 more variables: count <dbl>,\r\n#   loca_usable <chr>\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\ntask1\r\nintroduction\r\nUsing just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular.

Although we can infer from the call out ‘S$ 136.2 Bil’ that the unit is billion, it will be more clear to add the unit either to axis label or axis title.\r\nThere is no tick mark, grid line or tooltip and the call out only shows the total value. This make it difficult for readers to know the specific import or export value.\r\nThere is no title, no period information. Readers cannot know these values are calculated during which period and why these markets are shown but not other markets.\r\nThe figure cannot reflect the information in the blue rectangle. It only shows the details of merchandise trade performance with major trading partners of Singapore in 2020, but the information includes the comparison before and after 2006/2009.\r\n1.3 Critics of Aesthetics\r\nThe original visualization has some parts may not be that beautiful.\r\nThe different color of every circle/market is redundant and meaningless. In the graph, every market is represented by a circle with a unique color, but the color actually does not convey any information and is not necessary.\r\nThere is no transparency and the size of circles is not appropriate so that there are some overlapping. Readers cannot clearly see the boundary of each circle and the distribution of all circles.\r\nThe top net exporter and importer are not that attractive since there are so many colors in the figure and they may distract readers.\r\n2.0 Alternative Graphical Presentation\r\nWe are going to create a sketch of what we are going to design, so that the following creating steps can go for that goal.\r\n2.1 Sketch\r\n\r\n2.2 Advantages\r\n2.2.1 clarity\r\nTry to unified the unit and add the unit label. So that readers can know the unit at first glance.\r\nKeep the grid line so that readers can check the value more clearly.\r\nAdd the graph title, subtitle and dashboard title which including the time period and the top n trading partners of Singapore so that readers can know the period is from 2011 to 2020 and the markets are the top n trading partners of Singapore.\r\nNot include the information of blue rectangle.\r\n2.2.2 Aesthetics\r\nLet the balance of trade set the color of the bubble. Red represents trade deficit and blue represents trade surplus. the higher the amount, the barker the color.\r\nNot set 100% opacity, set it to 75% and add a white border.\r\nInstead of sign, using annotate since the animations will change the place of the circle. And a market not always be the top net exporter/importer.\r\n2.2.3 Other added information\r\nBalance of Trade (BOT, export - import) is an important concept in analysis the trade, we add such a value in the graph to make it more straightforward. We use gray lines to represent it.\r\nAnimations can show the changes better, the show history function can record the trail of the circle in the past period.\r\n3.0 Tableau Design\r\nThe final visualization is shown below.\r\n\r\nThis link Trade Viz provides the tableau public website.\r\n4.0 Step-by-step Description\r\nNow we comes to the details of creating the new visualization.\r\n4.1 Data Preparation\r\nFirst of all, we download the data ‘outputFile.xlsx’ from the official website and check all the data we have. It is an excel file and contains three sheets, one is content, one is T1 (import) and another is T2 (export).\r\n\r\n4.1.1 Get the data for Import/Export/total/BOT\r\nWe open a new excel file and name it ‘merchandise’.\r\nBack to ‘outputFile’ and select ‘variable’ cell in T1 (import) sheet, press ctrl+shift+right to select the entire row and then press ctrl+shift+down to select the entire table. Copy the table and paste it to ‘merchandise’ ‘sheet1’ and renamed the sheet to ‘Import’.\r\n\r\nThen delete the row of ‘Total Merchandise Imports(Thousand Dollars)’ since we are focusing on the markets and will not use the total amount.\r\n\r\nDelete the rows of America, Asia, Europe, Oceania, Africa. The reason is the same, they are the sum of several markets in the whole continent. We will not use them since we are focusing more detail markets.\r\nAlso, we focus on the period from January 2011 to December 2020 and delete all other columns of periods. We select column B ‘1976 Jan’ and go to column PE ‘2010 Dec’, press shift and select the column, right click and select delete.\r\nWe delete the value of period from Jan 2021 to Apr 2021 using the same way.\r\n\r\nUsing the same steps to get the sheet ‘export’ from ‘T2’, delete the row of ‘Total Merchandise Exports(Thousand Dollars)’ instead of import.\r\n4.2 Data Visualization\r\nNow we open the tableau and start to create our visualization.\r\n4.2.1 Set the data source\r\nWe import the ‘Merchandise.xlsx’ and drag the ‘Export’ to the up right window.\r\n\r\nThen we split the ‘Variables’ column by click the triangle and select ‘split’. The results are as follow.\r\n\r\nWe can see that the unit of different markets are different, and some markets may split not that accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see that European Union is using Million as its unit. Later on we can create a new calculated field for the actual merchandise trade value.\r\nNow we change the name of the two new columns to ‘Market’ and ‘Unit’ and hide the original column.\r\n\r\nThen select the columns from ‘2011 Jan’ to ‘2020 Dec’ by click the first column, press ‘shift’ and click the last column.\r\nThen click the triangle at the top right side of the last column and select pivot.\r\n\r\nNext change the name of the pivot two new columns to ‘Period’ and ‘import’ and change their data types to ‘Date’ and ‘Number(Decimal)’.\r\n\r\nDo the same steps for export and set the relation ship between import and export as follow. That is, match the rows when the variables and the period are both the same.\r\n\r\n4.2.2 Set the correct data category\r\nFirst we check the ‘Tables’ and change the ‘import’ and ‘export’ from discrete to continuous by dragging them down to the continuous part.\r\n\r\n4.2.3 create calculated fields and parameters\r\nactual import and export values\r\nWe go to the Analysis -> Create Calculated Field and name the new measures ‘Actual_Import’ and ‘Actual_Export’. If the Unit of the row is ‘Million’ then the value of Actual_import/Export is import/export * 1000000, else (include those ‘Thousand’ and some inaccurate split) is import/export * 1000.\r\n\r\ntotal merchandise/balance of trade\r\nTotal merchandise is the sum of export and import value.\r\n\r\nbalance of trade is the difference of export and import.\r\n\r\nRank of total merchandise trade\r\n\r\npositive BOT and negative BOT\r\nThis is used for the tooltip.\r\n\r\n\r\ntop n markets and top n markets set\r\nWe want to set a interactivity so that readers can select top 5/10/15/20/… markets they want to check. So we need to set a parameter n.\r\nwe go to the data pane and click the triangle, select create parameter.\r\n\r\nThe name of the parameter is ‘top n markets’, we set the current value to 10, allowable values to range from 5 to 30, the step is 5.\r\n\r\nThen we comes to the Market of import, right click it and go to create -> set.\r\n\r\nChange tab to ‘Top’ and select ‘by field’, set the top n to ‘top n markets’ by sum of ‘Total Merchandise’. The name of the set is top n markets set.\r\n\r\ndiagonal reference\r\nThis is used for the diagonal reference line later on.\r\n\r\n4.2.4 set filters\r\nThere are two filters we need to apply, period and the top n markets set.\r\nFirst we drag period to the filters and select year, click next, select all and click apply.\r\n\r\nThen we right click the period filter and select ‘show filter’.\r\n\r\nChange the filter from multiple to single choice.\r\n\r\nNext we drag the top n markets set to the filters and right click top n markets parameter, select show parameter.\r\n\r\n4.2.5 Create the Bubble plot\r\nWe drag the Actual_export to Columns and Actual_import to Rows, then drag the market to detail, Total Merchandise to Size and Balance of Trade to color.\r\n\r\nThen we are going to make the size of the circles larger, set the opacity to 75% and add a white border.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, double click the color bar at the right side of the graph and check the ‘Use full color range’ and center 0’.\r\n\r\nThen we are going to add the X axis reference line.\r\n\r\nCustom the reference line to ‘Avg ’ and set the color and style of the line as follow.\r\n\r\nDo the same steps for Y axis reference line.\r\nDrag the Diagonal reference to Rows.\r\n\r\nClick the triangle in the right side and select Dual axis.\r\n\r\nComes to the Diagonal reference axis and select synchronize the axes.\r\nRemove all the color, label and tooltip for diagonal reference except market for detail.\r\n\r\nChange the mark from circle to line.\r\n\r\nRight click the diagonal reference line and comes to Trend lines -> Show trend lines.\r\n\r\nClick color and set opacity to 0.\r\n\r\nRight click the trend line and select format, set the format as follow(change the width of the line and set to dark gray).\r\n\r\nRight click the Diagonal reference and uncheck the show header.\r\n\r\nThen set all x and y axes to fixed range from 0 to 83,540,000,000.\r\n\r\nNext we change the value format of the tooltip. We click the sum(Actual_export) and select format, switch to pane and set the Numbers of Defult.\r\n\r\nWe choose Currency Custom, select appropriate type of negative value and set the display Units to Billion(B).\r\n\r\nWe do the same step to change Actual_import, Total merchandise and balance of trade.\r\nThen we drag the Market to label, and the Ranks, posiBOT, NegaBOT to tooltip. Edit the tooptip as follow.\r\n\r\nEdit the x and y axes labels, name of filters, title and the subtitle as following. The subtitle introduces the meaning of the size of the circle.\r\n\r\nSince we have already introduce the representation of the size of the circle, we comes to the size card of the bubble and hide it.\r\n\r\nThen we go to Format -> Animations and click on after Animations pane appears. Set duration to 1 second.\r\n\r\nDrag the year(period) from filters to pages.\r\n\r\nEdit the filter title and set the show history details, uncheck the show history for now.\r\n\r\nFinally we add some annotations and rename the sheet to ‘Merchandise Trade Performance’.\r\n4.2.6 Create BOT viz for tooltip\r\nWe are going to create a visualization of balance of trade for a market in a specific year and show this figure in the tooltip of previous sheet.\r\nFirst we drag the top n market set to filters, drag period to columns and set to month, drag two balance of trade to rows.\r\n\r\nThen set the two different y axis to different fixed range and delete the title of second axis.\r\n1st \r\n2nd \r\nDrag the balance of trade to label in All marks and set the format to currency custom, just the same as before.\r\n\r\nFinally go back to ‘Merchandise Trade Performance’ and edit the tooltip. Set the maxwidth to 600.\r\n\r\n4.2.7 Create the bar chart\r\nDrag the top n market set and market to filters, Period to columns, Total merchandise and posi BOT to rows and drag nega BOT to the second axis of posi BOT.\r\n\r\nAfter those we synchronize the two Y axes by right click the Y axis and select synchronize.\r\n\r\nThen we change the market filter to single value dropdown, edit the title and tune the color of measures to blue for surplus, red for deficit and gray for total merchandise.\r\n\r\nHide the field labels for columns, uncheck show header for the second axis for balance of trade and edit the exist posi BOT axis label to ‘Balance of Trade’.\r\n\r\n\r\nHide the indicator.\r\n\r\nSet the format of the three measures the same as those in the ‘Merchandise Trade Performance’.\r\n\r\nDrag the total merchandise to label of SUM merchandise mark and set the font size to 8.\r\n\r\nDo the same for nega BOT and posi BOT, instead of drag to the SUM merchandise mark, drag them to AGG nega BOT and AGG posi BOT separately.\r\nFinally rename the sheet ‘Total & BOT’.\r\n4.2.8 Create a Dashboard\r\nWe drag ‘Merchandise Trade Performance’ and ‘Total & BOT’ to the dashboard and adjust them.\r\nCheck Show dashboard title, edit the dash board title and two worksheet titles.\r\n\r\nThen edit the format of dashboard by going to format -> dashboard, set the default shading to light gray and the title shading to a relatively darker gray.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final dashboard is as follow.\r\n\r\n5.0 Observations\r\nThese are Singapore’s merchandise trade with its trading partners.\r\nFrom the bubble plot we can see that the closer the circle to the downright corner, the higher the trade deficit, otherwise the higher the trade surplus.\r\nClick show history.\r\n5.1 United States\r\nWhen we focus on the United States, we can see that from 2011 to 2017, it is always the largest trade deficit market of Singapore (trade deficit range from $12.75B to $20.98B).\r\n\r\nThen after 2017, Taiwan replace the US and became the market has the largest trade deficit. We can see from the bar chart that the total merchandise with US increased ($79.92B, $97.91B, $105.02B) but balance of trade remain almost the same ($15.19B, $15.22B, $14.40B). That is, the import and export value both increased but the difference did not change much. In the bubble plot the circle of US remove opposite the coordinate origin but did not cross the diagonal reference line passing through the origin.\r\n\r\nThe largest change happened in 2020. From the bubble plot we can see that the US circle cross the diagonal reference line, which means it came to net export from net import.\r\n\r\nIn the bar chart the total merchandise of US did not decrease significantly($105.02B, $102.43B), but the balance of trade changed significantly from -$14.40B to $5.67B.\r\nAs we all known, US trade deficit jumps to 12-year high in 2020 under the influence of covid 19, and the real GDP of the United States shrank by 3.5% in 2020 (reference), the largest annual decline since 1946. It is reasonable for Singapore to export more to US and import less than previous years.\r\nThe detail balance of trade of US was always below 0 before 2020. The trade surplus first appeared in April 2020.\r\nUS 2019 \r\nUS 2020 \r\n5.2 Malaysia and Mainland China\r\nWe can see that Malaysia was Singapore’s biggest trading partner in 2011 and 2012, Mainland China was the second, later on Mainland China replaced Malaysia as the biggest trading partner from 2013 to 2020, Malaysia was the second.\r\nbefore 2013 \r\nafter 2013 \r\nAfter checking the bar chart, we can see that the total merchandise seemed keep stable but balance of trade had a trend of decreasing since 2015. Before 2019 Malaysia was in the net Export area but 2019 it had a net import value $0.73B. In 2020 it witnessed the highest trade deficit during 2011-2020($11.65B). We can see that the structure of merchandise trade from Singapore to Malaysia was changing from net export to net import.\r\n\r\nThe first trade deficit appeared in Nov 2016 and when it comes to 2020, the balance of trade is all below 0.\r\nMalaysia 2016 \r\nMalaysia 2020 \r\n5.3 Indonesia\r\nIndonesia was the 8th biggest trading partner of Singapore in 2020. But from 2011 to 2013 it was the 4th biggest trading partner. The ranking kept falling from 2014 to 2020.\r\nPeriod\r\nRank\r\n2011-2013\r\n4\r\n2014\r\n5\r\n2015-2016\r\n6\r\n2017-2019\r\n7\r\n2020\r\n8\r\nIndonesia 2013 \r\nIndonesia 2020 \r\nIn the bubble plot we can see that Indonesia is moving towards the origin. That is, the total merchandise value was decreasing and also the balance of trade.\r\n\r\nWe can see in the bar chart that total merchandise trade value in 2020 ($48.82B) was almost half of that in 2011 ($81.56B) and the balance of trade in 2020 ($10.32B) was lower than 1/3 of that in 2011 ($32.40B).\r\n\r\nThis means that India’s influence over Singapore in trading area is declining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The ‘month of period’ of Japan is different from all the other 5 countries, it only has 2020, which is inconsistent with the title.\r\nThe Y axes are inconsistent. There are two Y-axes in every sub-picture, one for import and one for export. The two Y-axes have different scales. This may mislead readers if the pictures are similar but the scales are significantly different. What’s more, the different scales of the Y-axes of all 6 sub-pictures makes it difficult for readers to make the comparison among the 6 countries.\r\nThe Y axes are not accurate. We can see from the raw data that the unit is thousand dollars, but there is no note to explain this in the original visualization. This will mislead readers to treat the actually 4M thousand dollars to be just 4M dollars.\r\nThe title is not accurate. The figure cannot reflect that the six countries are the top six trading countries. And from the data set we can see that the top six countries of import, export, or total values are all not consistent with the six countries in the figure.\r\n\r\nThere is no subtitle and the title only introduces what are the pictures but cannot convey the point the pictures are going to present. No lead-in or called-out to offer the context.\r\n1.3 Critics of Aesthetics\r\nThe original visualization has some parts may not be that beautiful.\r\nThe area charts are not necessary. It does not convey any information, the overlap area makes is difficult to see clearly.\r\nThe color of import and export is not suitable. The overlap of light blue and light yellow makes the graph looks dirty, not clean.\r\nThe separate of six sub-graph distract readers and will lead readers to treat them separately.\r\n2.0 Alternative Graphical Presentation\r\nWe are going to create a sketch of what we are going to design, so that the following creating steps can go for that goal.\r\n2.1 Sketch\r\n\r\n2.2 Advantages\r\n2.2.1 clarity\r\nWe keep the period of all six countries to 2019 - 2020 so that it is consistent within the graph and fit what we are going to express.\r\nThe Import and Export use the same Y axis. also, all six countries use the same Y axis. Then it is absolutely clear for readers to make comparison.\r\nWe add a note in a pair of brackets to make readers know the value unit is thousand dollars.\r\nWe edit the title from ‘top six trading countries’ to ‘six large trading countries’. Avoid the misleading expression.\r\nWe edit the titles, add subtitles and annotations to graphs, and create dashboard titles.\r\n2.2.2 Aesthetics\r\nWe use line chart instead of area chart to make the graph neat and clean.\r\nWe set the color to blue and red (and gray if one more color needed) to make it looks beautiful.\r\nInstead of six separate sub-graph, we let the six countries next to each other so that readers will pay more attention to the comparison.\r\n2.2.3 Other added information\r\nBalance of Trade (BOT, export - import) is an important concept in analysis the trade, we add such a value in the graph to make it more straightforward. We use gray lines to represent it.\r\nYear-on-year Ratio helps to analysis the different between the trade values of this period and that of last period. We create a new line chart to reflect the year-on-year ratio of import and export of all six countries. From this chart we can see the increase or decrease in the same month of different years.\r\n3.0 Tableau Design\r\nThe final visualization is shown below.\r\nThis link Trade Viz provides the tableau public website.\r\n\r\n4.0 Step-by-step Description\r\nNow we comes to the details of creating the new visualization.\r\n4.1 Data Preparation\r\nFirst of all, we download the data ‘outputFile.xlsx’ from the official website and check all the data we have. It contains three sheets, one is content, one is T1 (import) and another is T2 (export).\r\nWe can know that we have the import and export data of hundreds of countries in different time, the total number of countries of import and export are different (import 120 countries, export 92 countries), and the time period starts from Jan 1976, ends in Apr 2021.\r\n4.1.1 Get the data for Import/Export/BOT\r\nWe just need to get the sheet contains only the data without other information.\r\nOpen the excel, copy the T1 sheet, which contains the import data, named the new sheet ‘import’ and delete the rows contains other information before and after the data.\r\nbefore: \r\nafter: \r\nDo the same steps for export data (T2) and get a new sheet ‘export’.\r\n4.1.2 Get the data for year-on-year ratio graph\r\nWe are going to get the statistic of import and export compare with the performance last year, only for 2020.\r\nMake copies of import and export sheet, named ‘Im_inter’ and ‘Ex_inter’. In the ‘Im_inter’ sheet, select the cells of first row and add a filter. In the ‘variables’ column select the specific six countries.\r\nCopy the value from Jan 2019 to Dec 2020 and paste below.\r\n\r\nIn the cell below 2020 Jan, type in the formula ‘the year-on-year ratio = (the import value in a specific month in 2020 - the import value of the month in 2019) / the import value of the month in 2019’ and drag down and right to get all the percentage of the six countries in 2020.\r\n\r\nWe copy all the percentage statistics and prepare a new sheet ‘Im_yoyr’ for further tableau exploration.\r\n Then do the same steps for export part and get a new sheet ‘Ex_yoyr’.\r\n4.2 Data Visualization\r\nNow we open the tableau and start to create our visualization.\r\n4.2.1 Set the data source\r\nWe import the ‘outputFile.xlsx’ and drag the ‘import’ to the up right window. Select the columns from ‘1976 Jan’ to ‘Apr 2021’ by click the first column, press ‘shift’ and click the last column, right click and select ‘pivot’.\r\n\r\nThen change the name of the three columns to ‘country’, ‘period’ and ‘merchandise import’. Click the ‘abc’ icon above ‘period’ column and change the data type to date, change the type of ‘merchandise import’ from ‘abc’ to ‘number(decimal)’ using the same way. Now the table looks like this.\r\n\r\nThen drag the export to the window and make the same changes. Also, set the relation ship between the import and export. It matches when country in import equals country Ex in export and period equals period Ex, the cardinality is one to one.\r\n\r\nDrag the ‘Im_yoyr’ to the window link to import. select all the columns exclude variables and pivot the table. Do the same changes to column name, column type and the relationship as figure below.\r\n\r\nDo the same steps for ‘Ex_yoyr’ and the result should looks like the figure below.\r\n\r\n4.2.2 Set the correct data category\r\nFirst we check the ‘Tables’ and change the ‘merchandise import’ and ‘merchandise export’ from discrete to continuous.\r\n\r\nAnd Drag ‘merchandise import’ below.\r\n\r\n4.2.3 Create a visualization for Import/Export/BOT\r\nWe are going to make a new visualization of the import and export data of the six countries from 2019 to 2020.\r\nFirst we drag the ‘Country’ of ‘Import’ to ‘Filters’ and check the six countries (Hong Kong, Japan, Mainland China, Malaysia, Taiwan, US), click OK.\r\n Then we drag ‘Periof’ of ‘Import’ to ‘Filters’ and select ‘#year’ click next and check only 2019, 2020.\r\n\r\nWe drag ‘Country’ and ‘Period’ from ‘Import’ to columns, click the plus icon to get the ‘month’ of ‘period’, and change the ‘month’ from discrete to continuous. Then we drag ‘Quarter’ and ‘year’ out.\r\n\r\nWe drag ‘merchandise import’ from ‘import’ to rows. Then drag ‘merchandise export’ from ‘export’ to the Y axis.\r\n\r\nClick the triangle above ‘Tables’ and select ‘create calculate field’, set the name to ‘Balance of Trade’ and the formula is ‘Balance of Trade = value of Exports - value of Imports’.\r\n\r\nDrag the ‘Balance of Trade’ from ‘Measure Names’ to the Y axis and change the color of the three lines to make it more beautiful and clear.\r\n\r\nFinally, we do following steps to modify the graph.\r\nRight click columns label area and select hide field labels for columns. We are going to hide the ‘country’ label since the name of the six countries are already enough to let readers know that the columns are about countries.\r\n\r\nRight click Y axis and change the name of Y axis to ‘Value of Import/Export/Balance of Trade (Thousand Dollars)’. The original name of Y axis is just ‘value’, which cannot let readers know that the unit is thousand dollars, we add this information to a pair of brankets to inform the readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight click the country name, select edit the X alias for all six countries, delete the space before country name and the note after country name to let the country name looks more neat and clear and avoid redundence since we have already include the unit information in the Y axis label.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen right click title area and edit the title and subtitle to make the title more accurate and include some important introduction about the picture in the subtitle.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight click the white space in the graph, hang on annotate and select area to add the annotation to the graph.\r\nWe are going to highlight some information to readers in the picture by adding the annotations.\r\n\r\nRight click the legend, select edit title and delete it in the new window. Then right click ‘Merchandise Import’ and select edit alias to delete ‘Merchandise’ and remain ‘Import’. Do the same for ‘Export’.\r\nWe edit the legend to make it looks more tidy.\r\n\r\nThe final ‘Merchandise Trade’ is as follow.\r\n\r\n4.2.4 Create a visualization for year-on-year ratio\r\nWe are going to create a line chart to show the year-on-year ratio of both import and export values for the six countries.\r\nWe drag the ‘Period im yoyr’ from ‘Im_yoyr’ to columns, change the level from year to month, and change it from discrete to continuous, remove ‘quarter’ and ‘year’.\r\nDrag the ‘Year-on-year Ratio Import’ and ‘Year-on-year Ratio Export’ from ‘Im_yoyr’ and ‘Ex_yoyr’ to rows.\r\nDrag the ‘Country im yoyr’ from ‘Im_yoyr’ to color.\r\nWe can see the draft as figure below.\r\n\r\nThen we start modify the graph. We edit the title and subtitle to give the core information, edit the Y axis title, right click the X axis and select edit axis and delete the title in the newly appeared window since the month names are enough to let readers know that X axis is about the time period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen we edit the legend by right click every country label and select edit alias. We keep the country name only to make it looks tidy.\r\nFinally add some annotates to let readers know the main information we are going to convey.\r\nThe final ‘Year-on-year Ratio’ is as follow.\r\n\r\n4.2.5 Create a dash board\r\nWe drag the ‘Merchandise Trade’ and ‘Year-on-year Ratio’ to the dashboard and adjust them.\r\nThen we check ‘show dashboard title’ and then edit it.\r\nWe introduce the visualization is about the ‘trade of six large trading countries’ in the dashboard title, so that we do not need to include this information in both title of the two graphs from two sheets.\r\n\r\nRight click the dashboard title area and select format title, select two different light gray for the dashboard background and title shading to make it looks beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final dashboard snapshot is as follow.\r\n\r\n5.0 Observations\r\n5.1 Value of Imports/Exports\r\nWe can see that Mainland China has the largest import and export values among these six countries. Hong Kong has significantly lower Import value. Japan and Taiwan have relatively similar Export values.\r\nFrom this point of view, we can see that Mainland China has the largest scale of merchandise trade among all the six countries.\r\n\r\n5.2 Balance of Trade\r\nWe can see from the gray lines that Japan seems to have an average of balance of trade closest to 0. Japan and Taiwan have similar Export, but Taiwan has higher trade deficit since it has higher Import. What’s more, Hong Kong faced a high trade surplus since it has a high Export but low Import.\r\n\r\n5.3 Year-on-year Ratio\r\nFrom the year-on-year ratio graph we can see that all the export year-on-year ratios of US are above 0, and all the import year-on-year ratios except one of March are below 0. In other word, the export value of US in 2020 has been witnessed to be increased compared to the previous period while the import value decreased generally.\r\nIt also can be confirmed from balance of trade. We can see that US is going trade surplus in 2020 from trade deficit in 2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
